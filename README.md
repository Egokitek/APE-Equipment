# A.P.E. Equipment

## Inspiration
Worksuit inspired by space and NBQ suits. Also inspired in armors like Iron Man, Halo and more...

## What it does
A protective equipment with helmet and/or worksuit. Intended to work in hazardous places. With filtered air and positive pressure to be protected against covid.

### Work in progress...

## How we built it
We develop the concept and deep into technical details, but we don't build anything yet.

## Challenges we ran into# 
Now we are working with the helmet, sensors and air filtering unit. The next challenge is develop the sw and sensors integration to work correctly. In the near future we need to design the protective suit and try to add more improvements.
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Be ready to create a team and work together in a really short time, getting results.

## What we learned
Sw tools to work in group. The Hackaton dynamics is a experience too.

## What's next for APEEquipment
Some of us want to create a prototype. A realistic milestone could be the next Maker Faire in bilbao, in october 2020.

## Built With
*3D printing
*Arduino
*Raspberry-pi
  
# Introduction

A.P.E. is an integral modular personal protection system consisting of helmet, suit, boots, gloves, accessories ...Starting with the most important, a helmet with PAPR system (powered air-purifying respirator).

## The problem that our project solves

This product is scarce in the market because is needed in hospitals and other critical sectors. But a lot of people will need this kind of equipment and we need increase production. Also a lowcost maker approach could be useful in this context.

## The solution we bring to the table

New protection systems adapted, improved, customizable, low cost and exportable to other activities and jobs.

## What we have done over the weekend

*Document the project and define the idea. 
*Video pitch
*Github account
*Several CAD designs and pieces to create a Bill of materials (BOM)

## The value of our solution after the crisis.

This project could contribute to solve the problem of face-to-face work in any environment.

## The necessities in order to continue the project.

Materials search, test development, financing, suppliers … Is a work in progress and we are commited to continue. A good milestone could be a prototype that could be presented in Maker Faire biblao (october 2020).

## The value of our solutions after the crisis.

It is a product that improves current protection systems so it remains valid after the time of crisis. It’s a protective equipment to work in workshops, hospitals and more.

# Helmet

*Lightweight and compact , is the main protection element. Includes the main control board and sensors, made of plastic (to be determined) using 3D printing techniques. It will consist of an internal frame with sockets to house the board and sensors. This frame will be covered by a strong piece, which will seal the frame.
*A complement to the helmet is a separate piece to complete the sealing in the neck.. This necklace in turn would carry the connection dock of the sensors of the suit, it would have a quick connection system with the helmet.
*We will try to adapt, as soon as possible, sensors with I2C bus communication. This brings simplicity and modularity.

## Sensors:

*Pressure: internal pressure sensor for ventilation regulation.
*Temperature: internal temperature sensor and air inlet temperature sensor.
*Humidity: internal humidity sensor.
*Air quality: O2, CO2, NOx levels.

##Communications:

*Bluetooth.
*Wifi.

## Audio:

*Microphones in stereo arrangement with frequency filtering.
*Headphones.

##Protections:

*Anti impact visor with UV protection.
*Acoustic protection.
*Inlet for filtered air intake, with passive filter, or forced ventilation.
*Air outlet with non-return valve with passive filter.
*Temperature regulation with liquid recirculation and a peltier plate.

# Suit

Must be a modular element configurable according to needs, composed of different layers of antibacterial, anti-abrasive fabric, ... Includes portable sensors for monitoring, as well as the necessary elements for the corresponding protections, depending on the type of performance to be performed, this can be a harness, integrated on the fabric, rigid protection on elbows and knees, etc. It must be comfortable and easy to remove and put on, for the normal work of a working day. 

## Characteristics:

*Composite fabric (antibacterial, breathable, anti-abrasive).
*Light and comfortable.
*Integrated protections.
*Integrated monitoring sensors.
*Control screen (flexible touch e-paper or more keypad) on forearm.
*Adjustable.
*Easy to dress and undress.
*Easy access for physiological needs.
